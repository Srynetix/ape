# ape (audio programming experiments)

This is a test project to get a grasp on the field of audio programming in general, using nice available libraries.  
In the end, this project will become a standalone audio plugin (like a VST plugin).

## How to use

Build everything with the `cargo build --release` command, then you can play with the options.  
For example, the project contains a ["bytebeats"](https://github.com/TuesdayNightMachines/Bytebeats/blob/master/Bytebeats_Beginners_Guide_TTNM_v1-5.pdf) synth, you can pass it a formula to compute (it uses Lua behind the scenes).
